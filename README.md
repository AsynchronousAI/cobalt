# luax
## What is it?
Luax is an simplified version of C and C++ based on Lua. It is written in C and is portable. It is also embeddable, interpreted, bytecoded, and assembly compiled. It comes with a load of libraries for USB 
control, FFI, audio, etc. Luax's focus is to be a portable language that works everywhere while being simple
and made to make applications and games.

## Features
- Built in libraries for graphics, audio, and more
- Ultrafast
- Way better syntax 
- Easy to learn
- Portable (Written in C)
- Embeddable
- Built in Lexer
- Interpreter
- Bytecode compiler
- Bytecode interpreter
- Vector3 and Vector2 class
- Transform class
- Assembly compiler
- Faster and more random number generator
- wait/swait (seconds), mwait (milliseconds, 1/1000 of a second), and uwait (microseconds, 1/1000000 of a second) functions with amazing accuracy
- Slicing like in Python (<string>.slice(<start>, <end>, <step>))
- Syntax like C and C++
- Class support (<name>: <class> = <value>)
- Easy way to get system variables (sys)
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- USB support
