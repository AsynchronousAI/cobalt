# Cobalt
cobalt is a Lua fork attempting to make a language as simple as lua into something as powerful as C.

## What Lua version is this based on?
This is based on Lua 5.4. It will be updated often to stay in sync with lua while having its own features.

Currently up to date with Lua `5.4.3`.
## Todo:
- Read typechecker todo
- Create a fork to link with lua updates
- Move cobalt libraries to the source code or a lib installer
- Document cURL
- Make AOT compile to ASM not C
